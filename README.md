# Britney Bot

This is my first [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/__freebritney)! Using the twitter API, my bot tweets information regarding the number of people vaccinated in the UK every 6 hours. Selenium was used to scrape this information from the PHE website, and the bot is hosted on Heroku.

My bot likes a random tweet tagged with '#freebritney' every 2 minutes. 

You can read more about how I created this bot on my [blog](https://symion-edwards.medium.com/automating-the-important-stuff-with-python-creating-a-freebritney-vaccination-twitter-bot-f708be767dc7)!
