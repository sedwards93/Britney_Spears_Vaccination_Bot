# Britney Bot

This is my first [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/__freebritney)! Using the twitter API, my bot tweets information regarding the number of people vaccinated in the UK every 6 hours. Selenium was used to scrape this information from the PHE website, and the bot is hosted on Heroku.

Going forward, I intend to add functionality so that my bot retweets and follows users that interact with it.
